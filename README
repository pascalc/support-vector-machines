An implementation of support vector machines in python

** Radial basis kernel - K = e^( -1*[(x-y)² / 2sigma²] )
The performance relies on the value chosen for sigma. To chose the optimum sigma that gives the best division of the data set one can implement a cross validation check, a method derived from statistics.
