Blue: Positive data points, i.e. indicator value is 1
Red: Negative data points, i.e. indicator value is -1
White X: Support vector points, also know has alpha (lagrange-multipliers). These values corresponds to the points which optimize the quadratic problem

Blue: Positive support vector
Red: Negative support vector
